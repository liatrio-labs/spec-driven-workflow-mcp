# Liatrio Launches Spec-Driven Workflow: A Codified, Versioned, Installable Framework for AI-Native Development

**October 18, 2025 —** Liatrio, an enterprise transformation consultancy, announced the Spec-Driven Workflow, an installable and versioned package that gives AI–native development teams a consistent way to ship features across products and platforms. The workflow drops into any repository like a standard package and instantly aligns contributors on the same work breakdown and execution model.

## The Problem: AI–Native Development Creates Inconsistency

Engineering teams adopting AI coding assistants face a challenge: each developer creates their own approach to prompting AI agents, organizing context and breaking down work. Architecture decisions scatter across Slack threads and wikis. One team ships small batch increments while another over‑engineers the first iteration. Context gets lost between sessions and across repositories. The problem further compounds across repositories – a platform with ten microservices needs ten consistent context stores, but maintaining that consistency manually is brittle. Teams either give up on standardization or spend engineering cycles fighting merge conflicts in shared templates.

## The Solution: Workflow as a Versioned Component

Liatrio’s Spec‑Driven Workflow treats your development process like any other library in your stack. Install it via `npx` or use it as an MCP, and it wires consistent structured context, work breakdown patterns and AI‑agent guidance into your project — whether you’re working on a weekend prototype or a multi‑repo platform. It provides a stable foundation even as teams use different or evolving AI tools, creating consistency where tool diversity surfaces friction.

The workflow features:

- Repeatable work breakdown guides small batch-deployable increments that keep feedback tight and progress visible.
- Scales from solo developers to enterprise platforms and keeps artifacts in predictable locations across single repos, multi‑repo platforms, or external storage — the same logical artifacts and semantic links regardless of location.
- Lightweight and minimal framework avoids overburdening context for AI agents and humans.

Engineering leaders already see impact:

> “Liatrio’s Spec‑Driven Workflow cut our context switching in half,” said Jordan Ramos, VP Engineering at VectorScale. “Specs, tickets, and agent prompts now live in the same backbone, and in our pilot quarter AI‑generated changes landed right the first time 40 percent more often.”
>
> “Product teams finally describe outcomes the same way engineering builds them,” added Maya Chen, Director of Product at Skyline Robotics. “We now draft outcome specs in hours instead of days because the workflow keeps every ticket, prompt, and roadmap in sync.”

## Built to Scale

The workflow scales from solo developers to enterprise platforms:

- **Single repository**: Keep everything local in Markdown files.
- **Multi‑repository**: Maintain consistent context across repos with 1:1 mappings between context artifacts.
- **External context storage**: Context can live outside repos entirely while maintaining the same structure.
- **Prompt‑first**: Works with just prompts — no heavy tooling required.
- **Multi‑tool**: Use different AI agents and work‑tracking systems together in the same project.
