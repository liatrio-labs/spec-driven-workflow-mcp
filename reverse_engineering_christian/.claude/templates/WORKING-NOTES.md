## Agent Collaboration Guidelines

**When updating this file:**
1. Add your findings to the appropriate section (don't create new files)
2. Reference and build upon other agents' work
3. Move resolved questions from "Open Questions" to "Decisions Made"
4. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the top
5. Keep the file organized and easy to scan

**Purpose**: This shared document prevents agents from creating separate files and fragmenting information. All agents (developer, infrastructure-architect, debugger, etc.) collaborate here.
